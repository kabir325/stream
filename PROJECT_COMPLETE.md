# 🎉 AgriLens Project - COMPLETE!

## 🌟 Project Overview
AgriLens is a comprehensive smart farming application that combines AI-powered disease detection, weather monitoring, crop recommendations, and an intelligent chatbot to help farmers make informed decisions.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🔍 **Disease Detection**
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses TensorFlow models to detect crop diseases from leaf images
- **Automatic Crop Classification**: Identifies Apple and Corn crops automatically
- **Detailed Diagnostics**: Provides disease details, causes, and treatment recommendations
- **PDF Reports**: Generates comprehensive analysis reports

### 2. 🌱 **Crop Recommendation**
- **ML-Based Suggestions**: Recommends optimal crops based on soil and climate conditions
- **Parameter Analysis**: Considers NPK levels, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall
- **Weather Integration**: Incorporates real-time weather data for better recommendations

### 3. 🌦️ **Weather Dashboard**
- **Real-Time Data**: Current weather conditions and 5-day forecasts
- **Agricultural Alerts**: Weather-based farming recommendations and warnings
- **Interactive Charts**: Temperature, humidity, pressure, and weather pattern visualization
- **Location-Based**: Supports any global location for weather data

### 4. 🤖 **AI Chatbot** ⭐ **NEW!**
- **Groq AI Integration**: Powered by Llama 3.1 70B model for intelligent responses
- **Agricultural Expertise**: Specialized knowledge in farming, diseases, and best practices
- **Dual Mode**: AI responses with pattern-matching fallback
- **Interactive Interface**: Quick-action buttons and chat history

## 📊 **Technical Stack**
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras for disease detection
- **Weather API**: OpenWeatherMap for real-time weather data
- **AI Chatbot**: Groq API with Llama 3.1 70B model
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas, Plotly for analysis and visualization
- **PDF Generation**: FPDF2 for report creation

## 🔧 **Setup & Installation**
